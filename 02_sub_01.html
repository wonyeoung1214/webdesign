        <p class="text 1">She’s been a visionary behind big blockbuster films including The Box Trolls, Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies, and Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and her name is Annie Atkins, a graphic designer for film. On each project she’s tasked with crafting graphic pieces outlined in film scripts that blend seamlessly into the sets and transport the viewer into alternative worlds. For over a year now she’s been holding weekend workshops in her studio, explaining what she does to university students and design professionals alike, letting them know how they can get in on it too. Annie is happy spill all her secrets to thankful ears, but to learn why, it’s important to understand the journey she’s been on.
        <br><br> Annie’s career didn’t start in film; straight after graduating with a degree in visual communications, the designer went on to become an art director in ad land for McCann Erickson at the agency’s Iceland offices. After a few years her enthusiasm started to wane when she found herself doing the same work for the same clients, over and over again: “I never felt like I was particularly good at it and I started not to enjoy it,” she says. Needing a break from design Annie enrolled in a master’s in film production at Dublin City University, “I thought I’d leave design completely, that I’d study film and be a camera operator or a technician, and then I found this whole other world of design,” she says.
